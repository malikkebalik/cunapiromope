Ayer's next film was 2016's "Suicide Squad," which he wrote and directed.</p><p>With a gross of $747 million at the box office, "Suicide Squad" has been David's most commercially successful film, but during a 2023 appearance on <a href=# title="Jon Bernthal Net Worth">Jon Bernthal</a>'s "Real Ones" podcast, Ayer stated:</p><p>"<strong>Come right off 'Fury,' right? I had the town in my hand â€” could've done anything, and I did do anything. And [I] go on this journey with ['Suicide Squad']. And the same thing â€” authentic, truthful, let's do all the rehearsal, let's really get in each other's souls. Let's create this amazing, collaborative thing, right? And then 'Deadpool' opened, right? And they never tested 'Batman v. Superman,' so they were expecting a different result, and then they got hammered by all the critics. Then it's like, 'Okay, we're going to turn David Ayer's dark, soulful movie into a f***ing comedy now.'</strong>"</p><p>David added, "<strong>All I know is my unseen film plays much better than the studio release</strong>." Due to the changes made to the film, fans began a #ReleaseTheAyerCut campaign on social media.</p><p>After "Suicide Squad," David directed and produced the 2017 urban fantasy "Bright," and the following year, he formed Cedar Park Entertainment with <a href=# title="Chris Long Net Worth">Chris Long</a>, who was formerly the Audience Network's head of programming.
