<time>08 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p id=par-1_41>Since Deion Sanders entered the public consciousness, he’s been characterized by his larger-than-life persona and achievements. It’s fitting that his love life is similarly dramatic. The <a href=#>Hall of Fame cornerback</a> has been married twice. Both partnerships fell apart in exhausting ways.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_55>Sanders’ most recent relationship appeared to be much more stable. He was engaged to Tracey Edmonds, a Hollywood producer and businesswoman, until December 2023. They’d been together for over a decade and were outspoken about their affection for each other.&nbsp;Here’s what you should know about their marital histories and current relationships, including their massive earnings.</p><h2 id=h-both-deion-sanders-and-tracey-edmonds-have-been-married-twice-before>Both Deion Sanders and Tracey Edmonds have been married twice before</h2><p id=par-3_35>Sanders married his first wife Carolyn Chambers in 1989, the same year he entered the NFL with the Atlanta Falcons. They stayed together until 1998 and had two children, Deion Sanders Jr. and Deiondra Sanders.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-4_44>The dissolution of a marriage is often a miserable experience, and it certainly was in Sanders’ case. In his autobiography Power, Money & Sex: How Success Almost Ruined My Life, he admitted that he drove his car off a cliff in an attempted suicide.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_35>“I was going through the trials and tribulations of life. I was pretty much running on fumes,” he recounted to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andscape</a>. “I was empty, no peace, no joy. Losing hope with the progression of everything.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_49>Sanders married his second wife, Pilar Biggers-Sanders, the following year. They had three children together: two sons, Shilo and Shedeur, and a daughter named Shelomi. The pair turned their partnership into content for the reality show Deion & Pilar: Prime Time Love, which aired on Oxygen in 2008.</p><p id=par-7_22>Deion announced that he filed for divorce in 2011. But the process quickly turned ugly and took two years to complete.</p><p id=par-8_63>Edmonds has also been married twice before. She wed R&B singer and producer Kenneth “<a href=#>Babyface</a>” Edmonds in 1992. The TV personality gave birth to their two sons, Brandon and Dylan, before separating in 2005. Edmonds also exchanged vows with Eddie Murphy in 2008. But the couple released a statement claiming the ceremony was more of a symbolic union before breaking up soon afterward.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-deion-sanders-and-tracey-edmonds-have-both-made-a-lot-of-money-in-their-careers>Deion Sanders and Tracey Edmonds have both made a lot of money in their careers</h2><p id=par-9_88>Their lucrative careers made them quite an impressive power couple.&nbsp;Sanders is the more famous half of the duo due to his career in football as a player, analyst, and <a href=#>head coach</a>. The father of five has made the bulk of his money throughout his time in the NFL but raked in another $13 million moonlighting as a baseball player for nine years. He also had plenty of endorsements as well as real estate ventures and today has a net worth of $45 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_74>However, his net worth is much less than his ex-fiancée Edmonds, who is worth a cool $60 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. She initially pursued a career in mortgage and real estate before moving into the creative fields. As the CEO of Edmonds Entertainment, she has produced dozens of projects for TV, the film industry, and digital media. Edmonds is also on the national board of directors for the Producers Guild of America.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-sanders-and-edmonds-showcased-their-relationship-on-reality-tv>Sanders and Edmonds showcased their relationship on reality TV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Tracey-Edmonds-fiance-Deion-Sanders.jpg><p id=par-11_49>Edmonds and Sanders began dating in 2012. They met at a party celebrating the release of a movie Edmonds worked on and made plans for her to produce the show&nbsp;Deion’s Family Playbook for Sanders. By the time the show aired, she was filming alongside the retired NFL player.</p><p id=par-12_25>Sanders and Edmonds also appeared on an episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>Tiny House Nation</a>,&nbsp;although their careers don’t allow them to stay in the same city for long periods.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_46>They own a ranch together in Canton, Texas. But Sanders works in Colorado as the coach of the University of Colorado Boulder and Edmonds works in Los Angeles.&nbsp;The couple has no issues with having a long-distance relationship because they see value in what the other does.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxprXOp2SsmZ6ZsrO%2FjJ%2BgmqaTmrJuw86rq6FlYmV6rrXLpaCopl2ivLOxjKGYpaRdm66usYynnaVloKGuurHRZ5%2BtpZxk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdeion-sanders-fianc%25C3%25A9e-was-worth-15-million-more-than-the-hall-of-fame-nfl-player.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdeion-sanders-fianc%25C3%25A9e-was-worth-15-million-more-than-the-hall-of-fame-nfl-player.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdeion-sanders-fianc%25C3%25A9e-was-worth-15-million-more-than-the-hall-of-fame-nfl-player.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdeion-sanders-fianc%25C3%25A9e-was-worth-15-million-more-than-the-hall-of-fame-nfl-player.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdeion-sanders-fianc%25C3%25A9e-was-worth-15-million-more-than-the-hall-of-fame-nfl-player.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdeion-sanders-fianc%25C3%25A9e-was-worth-15-million-more-than-the-hall-of-fame-nfl-player.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gloria-estefan-s-sprawling-miami-beach-guest-home-is-back-up-for-sale-at-32-million.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gloria-estefan-s-sprawling-miami-beach-guest-home-is-back-up-for-sale-at-32-million.html>Gloria Estefan's Sprawling Miami Beach Guest Home Is Back Up For Sale At $32 Million</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./charlie-schlatter-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Charlie Schlatter Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./charlie-schlatter-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
