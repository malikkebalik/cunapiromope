His subsequent releases were "It's Uptown" and "The George Benson Cookbook".</p><p>Benson worked for <a href=# title="Miles Davis Net Worth">Miles Davis</a> in the mid-60s before going to Verve Records.

During this period, he also contributed to sessions for other CTI artists, including Stanley Turrentine and Freddie Hubbard, particularly on the former's "Sugar" album.</p><h2 id=breakthrough-years-1970s-80s><strong>Breakthrough Years (1970s and 80s)</strong></h2><p>By the mid-to-late 1970s, Benson gained a new audience while recording for Warner Bros.
