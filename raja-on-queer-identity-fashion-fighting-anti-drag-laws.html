<time>10 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>“I have a master’s degree in fierce,” <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Raja</a> proclaimed 12 years ago on her journey to winning the third season of <a href=# class=T3D>RuPaul’s Drag Race</a>. Dubbed the “OG Fashion Queen” by Drag Race fans and fellow performers for <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>her impeccable looks</a> on that early season, Raja is the textbook example of drag royalty — and that doesn’t include her weekly critiques as host of the franchise’s <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Fashion Photo RuView</a> or her <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>remarkable return</a> to the runway on the 2022 winners-only season.</p><p>Longtime Drag Race judge <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Michelle Visage</a> didn’t hesitate to give her a fitting label when asked what superlative Raja should have for Bustle’s 2023 Pride Yearbook: “Best Dressed.” Vogue magazine once pinpointed her <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Marie Antoinette-inspired ensemble</a> from Season 3 as a career highlight, while All Stars 7 viewers are still gagged over Raja’s expensive <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>3D-printed dress featuring 200 lasers</a> and Swarovski crystals.</p><p></p><p>The 49-year-old queer entertainer, who served as a makeup artist on Tyra Banks’ America’s Next Top Model before achieving Drag Race fame, is enjoying Pride Month with a healthy combo of activities: making public appearances at Pride celebrations, “enjoying sips of wine, and consuming cannabis on my terrace with friends at home,” she tells Bustle.</p><p>Below, Raja picks her Pride Yearbook superlative and explains that daydreaming is vital to her self-care.</p><h2>Raja On Having “Strong Hope” In The Queers & Allies Battling Drag Bans</h2><p><strong>What superlative would you give yourself for the 2023 Pride Yearbook?</strong></p><p>My superlative would be Most Divine. I am in constant evolution, and my journey has only found success by connecting to divinity and the higher power, listening to my instincts, and allowing myself to utilize all the gifts.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><strong>How do you feel about anti-drag laws popping up across the nation? What would you say to lawmakers who are opposing the art of drag?</strong></p><p>We are all aware of the anti-drag laws and legislation that places us potentially in danger. It is frustrating and enraging; it can feel scary and hopeless. But I feel the opposite of fear, and I have strong hope. I have hope in the queers and allies generations behind me. These laws won’t stick. We are too powerful. Drag isn’t just a subversive art form anymore —&nbsp;it is an industry. We have always been powerful and that threatens those who’ve never sought enlightenment. We are also fighters. We didn’t get to this point in history without a battle.</p><p><strong>What were some of your go-to songs or artists in high school? How about today?</strong></p><p>My teen years were all about music. Being a queer kid in the ’80s and ’90s was a natural magnet to all things “alternative.” My gravitational pull was toward new wave, goth, punk; wearing a lot of black, Manic Panic hair, fishnets, and Doc Martens. It was the style that drew me in as much as the music. I also loved dance and house music because I’d started to find a tribe in the club world.</p><p>My go-to songs were <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>“Groove Is in the Heart”</a> by Deee-Lite and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>“Cities in Dust”</a> by Siouxsie and the Banshees. Today, my go-to tends to be in thoughtful pop artists like <a href=# class=T3D>Tove Lo</a> — I can listen to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>“Disco Tits”</a> all day on repeat.</p><p><strong>Tell us about your self-care routine and mental health tips.</strong></p><p>My self-care routine varies. I’m most happy when I’m home surrounded by my creative process and lots of projects. I feel most sane in the comforts of my space, to do as I please and daydream. Daydreaming is my self-care and mental health tip. As a child, I was constantly being reprimanded for my wandering mind. As an adult, it is essential.</p><p><strong>Who are your favorite drag queens and why?</strong></p><p>My favorite drag queens are anyone who embraces irreverence and breaks rules and expectations. Drag culture has become saturated with trends and sameness. I enjoy the weirdos and out-of-the-box thinkers.</p><p><strong>What is the most memorable drag show you’ve ever attended?</strong></p><p>The ones that left the biggest impressions were the performances I witnessed while still in high school. There was a queen named Barbarella who was the star of the club. She was tall and slender and performed in looks that blew my mind. She was aspirational to young me.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZquZmpZ6sb7InZxmsZWWv6O7zqRknaqRnHqzrcKeZJ%2BZo522sLqMqZ%2BorJ9iv7bCyJ6uZqSRrMA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fraja-on-queer-identity-fashion-fighting-anti-drag-laws.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fraja-on-queer-identity-fashion-fighting-anti-drag-laws.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fraja-on-queer-identity-fashion-fighting-anti-drag-laws.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fraja-on-queer-identity-fashion-fighting-anti-drag-laws.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fraja-on-queer-identity-fashion-fighting-anti-drag-laws.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fraja-on-queer-identity-fashion-fighting-anti-drag-laws.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-is-lucia-oso-is-figuring-it-out.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-is-lucia-oso-is-figuring-it-out.html>Where Is Lucia?
