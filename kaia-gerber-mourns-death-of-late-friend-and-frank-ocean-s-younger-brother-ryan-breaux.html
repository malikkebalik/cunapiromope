One of those taking to social media to tribute them is one of their friends, <a href=#>Kaia Gerber</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kaia-Gerber.jpg><h2>Details of the accident</h2><p id=par-2_100>Last week, it was reported that Breaux and his friend, Ezekiel “Zeek” Bishop, died in a car crash. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ABC7</a>&nbsp;reported at the time that two people died in a fiery car crash in Thousand Oaks, California. The news station said according to the early investigation, their car “appeared to leave the roadway and collide with a tree in the center median. The force of the crash caused the car to rip in half and was found by Ventura County sheriff’s deputies engulfed in flames.” Both people in the car were pronounced dead. They were later identified as Breaux and Bishop.</p><p id=par-3_33>By Tuesday, <a href=#>the coroner officially confirmed</a> their deaths, stating that they both died from “blunt force head injuries” as a result of the collision. As of Tuesday, toxicology results were still pending.</p><h2>Who were Ryan Breaux and Zeek Bishop?</h2><p id=par-4_49>Per <a href=#>The Los Angeles Times,</a> both graduated from &nbsp;Oaks Christian High School in 2019. Bishop was a student-athlete at Cal State Northridge. His personal website <a href=#>has now been converted</a> to a memorial where friends and loved ones can pay their respects, as well as revisit memories of him.</p><p id=par-5_93>Breaux, the second son of Katonya Breaux, had a close relationship with his older brother, Ocean. He was considered to be his brother’s muse. The Ocean’s 2011 track “Orion” is widely thought to be about Breaux. His voice was also featured on “Futura Free” from Ocean’s most recent album, blond. Living a largely private life much like his brother, Breaux was garnering fame of his own as he aspired to be a fashion designer. Before his death he had over 30,000 followers on Twitter and as of now, he has over 50,000.</p><p id=par-6_71>In a 2017 interview, the brothers’ mother talked about the relationship between her sons. When asked if she was Ocean’s biggest fan, she told <a href=#>Billboard</a>, “I would definitely so—well, maybe Ryan. Ryan will put those songs on repeat 50 times a day. I would definitely say Ryan, and I’m number two.” She posted a photo with Breaux without a caption a couple of days ago, seemingly as a tribute to him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>Tributes continue to come in from friends, including Kaia Gerber</h2><p id=par-7_17>Those close to Breaux and Bishop continue to remember them, including actress and model Kaia Gerber.</p><p id=par-8_100>She wrote on Instagram, “Ryan and Zeek, my heart is so heavy right now. I can’t put into words how grateful I am for every second I was lucky enough to spend with you,” Gerber wrote on Instagram. “The two people who made me smile the biggest. I will never forget that. I can still feel you here. I can still hear your laughs. I promise to keep trying to smile for you, I love you both forever. ❤️ rest peacefully always by each other’s side.” People commented on Gerber’s post to pay respects, including her mother Cindy Crawford.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_42>Gerber also shared a <a href=#>GoFundMe</a> created by Bishop’s family, which is “set up to honor Ezekial’s dreams and hopes of one day caring for his baby sister, Faith. All monies will go to fund Faith’s future as we keep Ezekial’s dream alive.”</p><p id=par-10_15>Our thoughts continue to be with the Breaux and Bishop families at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4orXAZp6eqpKav265zq6pp6tdmbKiwMdmpp9lnJbBpnnFq6CeppRirq%2BwjJ%2BpmqabYrykscCnqmaxn6q7qLHRZpmrp6SdsrN50bKYp2WSp7Kiwddnn62lnGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkaia-gerber-mourns-death-of-late-friend-and-frank-ocean-s-younger-brother-ryan-breaux.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkaia-gerber-mourns-death-of-late-friend-and-frank-ocean-s-younger-brother-ryan-breaux.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkaia-gerber-mourns-death-of-late-friend-and-frank-ocean-s-younger-brother-ryan-breaux.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkaia-gerber-mourns-death-of-late-friend-and-frank-ocean-s-younger-brother-ryan-breaux.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkaia-gerber-mourns-death-of-late-friend-and-frank-ocean-s-younger-brother-ryan-breaux.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkaia-gerber-mourns-death-of-late-friend-and-frank-ocean-s-younger-brother-ryan-breaux.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./n-golo-kant%C3%A9-wife-jude-littler.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./n-golo-kant%C3%A9-wife-jude-littler.html>Ngolo Kant wife: Jude Littler</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-to-italicize-text-on-an-iphone-in-3-different-apps.html>How to italicize text on an iPhone in 3 different apps</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-to-italicize-text-on-an-iphone-in-3-different-apps.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
