Both of his parents were missionaries while he was growing up, which meant that he frequently traveled with his family. As a child, the family spent time living in Germany, Egypt, and many other nations all around the world. In addition, Baker lived in many different US states. Eventually, he and his father laid down roots in Denver after his mother left the family.</p><p>As a teen, Baker was bullied and started fighting back using words. Eventually, he fell in love with rap and started to work on his own music. When his father left him to work for the Army in Kuwait, Baker lived in a neighbor's basement and started experimenting with drugs. It was during this time that he recorded his first mixtape, Stamp of Approval. Baker eventually stopped going to school, prompting his father to take him to Kuwait to live there.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>While finishing up high school after returning to the States, Baker convinced an MC manager to help him launch his career. It was at this point that Baker adopted the stage name "Machine Gun Kelly" as a reference to his fast-paced vocal delivery. MGK started performing at local venues and eventually appeared at Harlem's Apollo Theater. He also appeared on MTV2's Sucker Free Freestyle. He then released his second mixtape: 100 Words and Running. Although MGK was gaining exposure during this time, he continued to struggle financially. He was kicked out of his family home by his father, became a father himself, and worked at Chipotle to support himself.</p><p>MGK took a major step forward when he released the single "Alice in Wonderland." The track won him numerous awards and increased his notoriety before the release of his new mixtape, Lace Up. One of the tracks was dedicated to the Cleveland Cavaliers, and it was played at their stadium during home games. Following this successful run, MGK collaborated with <a href=# title="Juicy J Net Worth">Juicy J</a> on the single "Inhale." In 2011, MGK was approached by Sean Combs, who signed him to the record label Bad Boy Records.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-299463 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Machine-Gun-Kelly-1.jpg alt width=900 height=701 sizes="(max-width: 2084px) 100vw, 2084px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-299463 class=wp-caption-text>John Sciulli/Getty Images</p><p>In 2012, MGK was finally ready to release his debut studio album, entitled Lace Up.

As the feud continued, Eminem eventually banned MGK from appearing on his online radio station. One of MGK's most famous Eminem diss tracks was 2018's "Rap Devil".</p><p>In 2019, MGK released Hotel Diablo, his fourth studio album. The album contained the singles "I Think I'm Okay" and "Glass House," and debuted at number 5 on the charts.
