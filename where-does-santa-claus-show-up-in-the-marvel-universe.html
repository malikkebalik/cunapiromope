The jolly man in red has been seen in a load of media, from beloved poems like&nbsp;The Night Before Christmas&nbsp;to movies like&nbsp;The Polar Express.&nbsp;And, of course, Santa has made many appearances in comic books. But the Santa found in the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel</a>&nbsp;</strong>comics universe is highly unusual, presenting a unique take on the Kris Kringle we all know and love.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<h3 id=h-the-origins-of-marvel-santa data-injectable=false>The origins of Marvel Santa</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Strange-Tales-34.jpeg><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Santa’s origins within the Marvel universe are actually surprisingly detailed. The 2006&nbsp;Marvel Holiday Special&nbsp;featured a segment called “Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Santa Claus.” This chapter detailed the character’s in-universe history.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>One of the most fascinating parts of this segment is that it found Santa’s first Marvel comic appearance. The character made his debut in 1955’s&nbsp;Strange Tales #34&nbsp;(though it should be noted that Marvel was still known as Atlas Comics at the time). Santa appeared in a tale called “Moment Of Glory,” where he materialized to help a down-on-his-luck car mechanic realize how lucky he was. However, this version of Santa was vastly different from the man seen in later Marvel comics.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Interestingly, the&nbsp;Marvel Holiday Special&nbsp;lists off several real-world origins for Santa and similar winter festive figures before describing the Santa found within the Marvel universe by saying:&nbsp;</p><p>“The precise origins of Santa Claus are unrevealed, but Santa Claus is actually a magical being composed of elements of the various beings described above. Humanity’s collective beliefs in these legendary figures merged with spiritual energy, and aspects of the beings themselves gave him form as a manifestation of the spirit of giving associated with Christmas and other such holidays.”</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>This guide also links most of Santa’s appearances up to that point. So it retroactively makes Marvel’s Santa a cohesive character rather than a series of unlinked cameos.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-santa-meets-nick-fury data-injectable=false>Santa meets Nick Fury</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nick-Fury-Agent-Of-Shield-10.jpeg><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>One of the oddest Santa appearances in the Marvel universe comes in&nbsp;Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD #10, which hit shelves in 1968. In this story, Hate-Monger (himself a clone of Hitler) rises from the grave and tries to wipe out most of humanity using a germ bomb.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>However, Hate-Monger sends two fighter planes after the bomb to guarantee it lands. While these planes are in the air, an unidentified object sweeps past at high speed, clipping one of the planes. This causes the plane to crash into the bomb, ruining it. While not seen, Fury believes that this unidentified flying object is Santa Claus on his sleigh.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>The previously mentioned “Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Santa Claus” includes this storyline, confirming that it was actually Santa who did the deed.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-santa-meets-spider-man data-injectable=false>Santa meets Spider-Man</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Peter-Parker-The-Spectacular-Spider-Man-112.jpeg><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Interestingly, Marvel’s Santa isn’t always the jolly old pacifist that traditional carols make him out to be. This is seen in 1986’s&nbsp;Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #112.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>When Spider-Man learns that a mall Santa is tricking kids into letting him inside so he can rob them, he quickly swings out to stop him. However, while chasing the criminal, Spider-Man encounters the real Santa. This Santa seems very angry that someone is using his identity for evil.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>(Interestingly, this Santa also complains about the 1984 slasher film&nbsp;Silent Night, Deadly Night, which also featured a villain dressed up as Santa.)&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>The next day, the thief is found in the Daily Bugle office, giving out toys to children. The former criminal announces he has turned himself in as, after a talk with the real Santa, he has decided to mend his ways.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-she-hulk-and-santa data-injectable=false>She-Hulk and Santa</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sensational-She-Hulk-8.jpeg><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>And anger isn’t the only way Marvel Santa differs from his traditional counterpart. 1989’s&nbsp;Sensational She-Hulk #8&nbsp;gave Marvel fans a version of St. Nick that loves to play detective and is an unrepentant flirt.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>This story sees She-Hulk trying to find evidence in a murder case. As she tries to find something, she is called by Nick St. Christopher, a detective who says he has some leads. This man helps She-Hulk get into places via their chimneys, leading to a few breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>As the case continues, Nick St. Christopher starts flirting with She-Hulk. Even giving her a special Christmas present. This comes to a head at the end when She-Hulk asks who Nick St. Christopher really is, only for Nick’s wife to turn up and drag him home. And, to make matters worse, a load of Reindeer dung appears in She-Hulk’s office.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>And, while it isn’t revealed in the comic itself, the “Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Santa Claus” does confirm that Nick St. Christopher is actually Santa.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-santa-meets-the-x-men data-injectable=false>Santa meets the X-Men</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Marvel-Holiday-Special-1991-2.jpeg><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>However, it would be Santa’s meeting with the X-Men that would really shape the Santa character within the Marvel universe. In 1991’s&nbsp;Marvel Holiday Special,&nbsp;there is a story called “A Miracle a Few Blocks Down From 34th Street.”</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>In this story, the X-Men are having fun decorating their Christmas tree when Cerebro, a mutant-locating device, informs the group that it has detected the “most powerful mutant ever registered.” The X-Men head out to find out who this mutant is, but they find that the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants has also turned up, keen to recruit this new mutant to their side.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>However, both are surprised to learn that this new mutant is Santa Claus. Santa turns the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants into toys before teleporting the X-Men away, wiping their memories of the fight. He then explains he won’t choose sides during Christmas. But he does give the city a white Christmas to make up for it.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>This appearance shows that Marvel Santa is not to be messed with. And it is one of Santa’s most known appearances in the Marvel universe.</p><h3 id=h-deadpool-and-let-himself-go-santa data-injectable=false>Deadpool and “Let himself go” Santa</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Deadpool-7-2018.jpeg><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>2018’s&nbsp;Deadpool #7&nbsp;gave Marvel fans the most off-kilter version of Santa ever made, which is fitting considering Deadpool’s overall tone.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>This story sees Tinsel, one of Santa’s elves, getting annoyed with Santa’s refusal to monetize. Because of this, Tinsel turns the other elves against Santa, causing them to all leave the North Pole.&nbsp;Without his elves and without his wife, Santa goes feral. Taking on a dirty, gaunt appearance and often only wearing his filthy y-fronts. Plus, he develops a potty mouth, screaming obscenities near-constantly.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>Due to this, Santa doesn’t deliver presents. A group of kids, upset by the lack of gifts, hires Deadpool to kill Santa, something Deadpool agrees to happily. However, when he gets to the North Pole, he learns that Santa isn’t going down without a fight.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-conclusion data-injectable=false>Conclusion&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Marvel-Holiday-Spectacular-2009.jpeg><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>This shows that Santa is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel universe. While his status of “most powerful mutant” might be debatable, the fact that Santa has done all of this stuff shows that he is strong, at least on the level of most of the Avengers.</p><p data-characters=661 data-current-count=935 data-injectable=true>And this isn’t the only time Santa has been seen within Marvel Comics, as he’s also appeared in some other Marvel universes. For instance,&nbsp;Marvel Holiday Spectacular 2009&nbsp;gave readers a version of Santa who can handle the Infinity Gauntlet and survive. Which makes him one of only a select few people. And, in 1991’s&nbsp;What The–?! #16&nbsp;Doctor Octopus captures Santa and forces his elves to make evil toys. However, one of these toys hurts Cassie Lang, Ant-Man’s daughter. When Ant-Man shrinks Doc Ock down to fight him, Santa can return both men to regular size, meaning that Santa can control Pym particles.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=98 data-injectable=false>Basically, if you’re on the naughty list in the Marvel universe, you better watch out.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX6y1pr7EZpuonaNiwKK605pknKSRqsBuv8eormatoGK2r3nToZxmpZGnw6a4jK6loq6Vp8Cmew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-does-santa-claus-show-up-in-the-marvel-universe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-does-santa-claus-show-up-in-the-marvel-universe.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-does-santa-claus-show-up-in-the-marvel-universe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-does-santa-claus-show-up-in-the-marvel-universe.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-does-santa-claus-show-up-in-the-marvel-universe.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-does-santa-claus-show-up-in-the-marvel-universe.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wyclef-jean-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wyclef-jean-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Wyclef Jean Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./new-holland-tm165-price-specs-review-attachments-2022.html>New Holland TM165 Price, Specs, Review, Attachments 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./new-holland-tm165-price-specs-review-attachments-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
