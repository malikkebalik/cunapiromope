They are known for being passionate, creative forces of nature who demand attention, even if it’s just by the mere fact of their existence in a space. They are the fixed fire sign, the smoldering coals, providing heat without needing to do much.</p><p>Leo represents childhood; not the early childhood of learning lessons and figuring out how to be in the world, but free, timeless childhood, where the only thing that matters is play; the physical embodiment of creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=toc-what-is-a-spirit-animal class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">What Is a Spirit Animal?</h2><p><a href=# data-type=post data-id=10365>Zodiac spirit animals</a> are animals that can be looked to for clues about energies surrounding certain signs. Rather than one animal that acts as a guide throughout one’s life, as in many indigenous cultures, there are many animals that embody the traits of a certain sign.</p><p>Since there are no two people of the same sign who are exactly alike, the zodiac spirit animals encompass many different aspects of a sign’s energy.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=toc-what-are-the-leo-spirit-animals class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">What Are the Leo Spirit Animals?</h2><p>All of the animals that represent or embody Leo have a trait in common: they command attention, and they handle that attention well. Most of these animals are hard to look away from when in their natural element, and it is often the same with Leos.</p><p>Even if they aren’t consciously making everything about them, the focus can naturally shift to them, just like a child in a group of adults.</p><p>Leos are represented of course by the majestic lion, as well as the gorgeous and somewhat cocky peacock. The colorful macaw enchants with talkativeness and social graces, while the fiery dragon demands respect and loves shiny things. Finally, the playful otter who embodies the childlike energy of Leo.</p><p>Let’s dive in to what makes these animals Leo spirit animals!</p><h3 id=toc-1-the-lion class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">1. The Lion</h3><p>Leo is, of course, represented first and foremost by the lion. The lion in mythology that gave the constellation its name was the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nemean Lion</a>, who would drag women from nearby towns to its lair, which would prompt would-be heroes to try to save them, only to meet their doom as well.</p><p>He was eventually defeated by Heracles – or Hercules, in Roman – as the very first of his twelve labors.</p><p>The lion represents much of the Leo personality. In medical astrology, Leo rules the heart, and lion-hearted is a well known euphemism for being strong and brave. Leos are both strong and brave.</p><p>Like lions, they can tend to be more concerned with leisure and relaxing time, until it’s time to get moving, when they become as focused and fierce as a lioness on the hunt. As a fire sign, they find it easy to get things going – even if it means an end to precious lounging time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/leo-spirit-animal.jpg><p>In the wild, lionesses are known as the hunters of the pack, while the lion in charge of the pride stays at home and feasts on their kill.</p><p>In reality, male lions hunt as well, only they do so in the tall grass, and with such deadliness that scientists didn’t know they did so, because anyone who encountered one met their demise. Leos are also often defying expectations or capable of more than people thought of them.</p><p>There is a common misconception that a Leo can’t be shy, which is not necessarily true. They can hide away and be totally unseen – it’s just that when a lion – or a Leo – is in the open, it’s hard not to give them your full attention.</p><p>Not only do Leos effortlessly command attention, but those who have Leo’s heart are treated to the brightness and warmth of their attention in return, which can be an intoxicating feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Leos also can sometimes share physical characteristics of lions – mainly, their gorgeous mane of hair. Those with Leo Suns and Risings often have amazing locks that they are very proud of. Speaking of pride, this is another valuable tenet of a Leo’s life.</p><p>As lions with their pride, Leos like to be part of a group – ideally the axis around which the group revolves, depending on the Leo. Leos also take pride in everything they do and everything they are, and they’re not going to apologize for it. And neither should they!&nbsp;</p><h3 id=toc-2-the-peacock class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">2. The Peacock</h3><p>Naturally, the peacock is a wonderful representation of Leo in the animal kingdom, outside of their usual lion comparisons. The reason why should be quite obvious: the gorgeous plumage they display when looking for a mate. Whether or not Leo is on the prowl, they always try to look their best in every situation.</p><p>Leos are well known for being one of the most creative signs, particularly when it comes to entertainment and being in the public eye.</p><p>Oftentimes Leo will naturally be drawn towards professions that allow them to be seen by others; in fact, there are many, many actors, musicians, and other entertainers who are Leos.</p><p>One thing that Leos can always be counted on for is bringing the drama wherever they go; whether that be positive or negative depends on the situation. Similarly, the peacock is an undeniably dramatic animal; impossible to look away from, and loud.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/leo-zodiac-animals.jpg><p>While we can’t look into a peacock’s mind to know how they feel about being one of the most beautiful birds in the bird kingdom, when watching them walk around, they give off a very confident energy. No one could ever accuse a peacock of having stage fright.</p><p>Oftentimes, even if a Leo is shy in one on one encounters, they light up when they have an opportunity to perform, whether that be literally performing, or any time they get a chance to show off their skills to other people.</p><p>Leos bask in attention and admiration as if it were the sun, which is their ruling planet (even though it’s a luminary – these count as planets in astrology).</p><p>Because they pay so much attention to themselves and their appearance, Leo can have a reputation for being cocky and arrogant. They do like to strut their stuff, but just because they might make others insecure with their security, doesn’t necessarily mean they are arrogant.</p><p>Okay, that might be a very Leo way of looking at things, and they can definitely come across as arrogant, and at times might become prone to being so full of themselves that they are difficult to get along with. Self-assuredness is intimidating to some people, but often Leo uses it as a mask for the insecurities they do face.&nbsp;</p><p>Being the sign that’s known for being beautiful, exuberant, and confident can have its own kind of toll, when they feel like they have to keep up a standard that others expect of them. Like the peacock, they are expected to put on a show every time they leave their door, when sometimes they’d rather trail their feathers behind them.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=toc-3-the-macaw class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">3. The Macaw</h3><p>Another colorful bird that represents Leo! Macaws are one of the most intelligent and communicative birds – and indeed, animals –&nbsp; in the world, because of their ability to mimic human speech. Leos are also known for being an intelligent and social sign, and loves nurturing friendships and relationships with many different kinds of people.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the peacock, the macaw’s feathers make them hard to miss. But even their gorgeous outer appearance is eclipsed by their astounding ability to speak in human language. When you see a Leo, you might first be drawn in by their appearance, but it will be their magnetic personality that keeps you entranced.</p><p>Leos have a way with words, and can make any story seem exciting and dramatic, because they become so animated when telling it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/macaw-zodiac-sign.jpg><p>Even if Leos aren’t necessarily seeking out attention, their natural charisma draws people to them. They can often feel obligated to “perform” even if they aren’t feeling it that day.</p><p>Luckily, as a fire sign, Leos have access to a lot of natural stores of energy and find their stamina for keeping those around them entertained to be quite hearty.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it’s not always the case, Leos can be very extroverted; that is, they refill their energy batteries by being around other people, especially those they love and trust.</p><p>Introversion and extroversion have nothing to do with being shy and quiet or loud and outgoing. An extrovert can certainly be shy when interacting with strangers, but prefer to be in others’ company, where they feel energized; especially their friends and family.</p><p>In the same way, despite being the life of the party and the center of attention, a Leo can be introverted and prefer to spend their free time recharging alone at home. Even then, they are most likely jumping into the group chat to tell another wild story in their special Leo way.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=toc-4-the-dragon class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">4. The Dragon</h3><p>Yes, Dragons are <a href=# data-type=post data-id=15560>mythical creatures</a>, unless you count the Komodo Dragon, but they deserve a spot on the Leo spirit animal list for their many similarities to Leo.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides being closely associated with fire, Leo’s element, dragons are also known for one thing: their obsession with gold and treasures. In legends about dragons, they are often the lords of a massive hoard of treasure. Similarly, while they might not be quite so stingy and protective over it, Leos have a love for the finer things in life.</p><p>Leo wants the best of everything. From the best champagne, to the best clothes and jewels, to the best friends, they carefully collect each proverbial piece of gold for their hoard. They might not necessarily need these things, but it pleases them to be able to look at tangible evidence of times in their life when they were able to obtain beautiful, rare, and treasured objects.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/leo-animals.jpg><p>Although it is not the case with everyone, Leos also like to do everything they can in order to make money; and for natural entertainers and creatives, it isn’t hard for them to be able to amass their own fortune.</p><p>While it might not necessarily look like a huge mansion in Beverly Hills or flashy cars – although there are plenty of Leo celebrities who do have those things – Leo wants all the things in life that make them feel “rich.” It is definitely in their nature for this to apply to material wealth, but can also mean being rich in friends, with a full, satisfying life.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides their riches, dragons are also known for their majestic beauty and presence; something that is obviously a theme with Leo. They effortlessly command attention, of course, because they are a giant winged creature shooting fire out of their mouth. How could anyone look away? But if you attract a dragon’s ire, you might find yourself scorched.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=toc-5-the-otter class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">5. The Otter</h3><p>Our final Leo spirit animal is one that steps away from the narrative of Leos being beautiful and majestic and commanding presence – although otters are, of course, very cute. The otter represents one of the best parts about Leo, which is what makes them popular, more than their outer appearance.</p><p>Leo is one of the signs that embodies pure “kid energy”, along with Aries and Gemini. They love to play, and aren’t known for taking things too seriously. Even when a Leo embarks on a serious project or endeavor, their approach is one of play and lightness.</p><p>If you’ve ever watched otters, you can see that they also possess this playful spirit. Even if they’re technically hard at work fishing and finding food for themselves, the otters seem like they’re having a great time doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Otters are also seen as symbols of romance, something that fills Leo’s cup. Sea otters will float side by side with each other, holding hands, never drifting apart; it’s adorable and romantic.</p><p>Leo loves romance and if there is any sign that is likely to send you a giant bouquet of roses and chocolates for a romantic occasion, it’s Leo, but they can also find the romance in the small, quiet moments you share, just the two of you.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-lkbff.nitrocdn.com/sTnyCEOWfGiIpLjCvEilsTGqVqpXJmFP/assets/images/optimized/rev-3b3f5c3/www.alittlesparkofjoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/animals-that-represent-leo.jpg><p>Leo’s can be passionate and devoted partners, who make you feel like the only person in the world. It can be disarmingly intoxicating to feel the full force of the sunny Leo personality trained on you, and many people find this impossible to resist. But you might not be the only thing the Leo sun shines on; they have enough for everybody.</p><p>Leos can certainly be in monogamous partnerships, but in that case they will often have friends and others in their life who they shower their attention on, and it can feel very dark and cold when that attention is drawn away from you.</p><p>Still, they are wonderful companions and fun to be around, and their goofy, playful antics can bring a smile to even the most saturnine cynic’s face.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=toc-which-leo-spirit-animal-are-you class="wp-block-heading ftwp-heading">Which Leo Spirit Animal Are You?</h2><p>Now that we’ve gone through all of the leo spirit animals, do you think there is any that represents you or the Leos in your life more closely?
