Lizzie Grubman is the daughter of entertainment lawyer Allen Grubman, and she founded her own PR firm in 1996, representing such celebrities as <a href=# title="Britney Spears Net Worth">Britney Spears</a>, <a href=# title="Jay-Z Net Worth">Jay-Z</a>, and the members of the boy band the Backstreet Boys. Her firm was the subject of the 2005 MTV reality television "PoweR Girls," a reference to a 1998 "New York" magazine profile of Grubman and two fellow publicists that proclaimed her "the most powerful girl of all." Lizzie is perhaps most famous for a 2001 incident in which she drove her SUV into a crowd of people standing outside a nightclub in the Hamptons after being asked to remove it from a fire lane. Sixteen people were injured, and&nbsp;Grubman subsequently spent 38 days in jail.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Lizzie Grubman was born Elizabeth Grubman on January 30, 1971, in New York City. Lizzie's parents, Yvette Grubman and entertainment lawyer Allen Grubman, divorced in the late '80s. Yvette suffered from multiple sclerosis, and sadly, she passed away from ovarian cancer at the age of 58. "Business Week" referred to Allen as "the most powerful lawyer in the music business" in 1992, and "Newsweek" dubbed him "perhaps the music industry's wealthiest and most powerful attorney" in 2001. Grubman has a younger sister named Jennifer, who earned a Juris Doctor from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Lizzie attended the prep schools The Lenox School, the Horace Mann School, and the Dwight School. After graduation, she enrolled at Boston's Northeastern University, but she dropped out during her sophomore year.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Grubman began promoting nightclubs in Boston, and in 1995, she took a job with PR agent Nadine Johnson, who represented "art world and luxury clients." The following year, Lizzie left and founded her own PR firm. In 1998, she was featured on the cover of "New York" magazine alongside two other young female publicists. The headline read "Power Girls," and the article stated, "Lizzie was clearly the most powerful girl of all." The article brought new clients to her business, including <a href=# title="Gloria Estefan Net Worth">Gloria Estefan</a>, Jay Z, and Sean Combs. Another client, Britney Spears, told "The New York Times" of Grubman, "She was there by my side and protected me when I was young and just getting into the spotlight. I was so grateful to know that Lizzie always looked out for me." In 2005, Grubman starred on the MTV reality series "PoweR Girls," which was about Lizzie "mentoring a team of young hopeful publicists as they work their way in the world of celebrities, glamour and public relations to ultimately earn a permanent spot on Grubman's team (along with her respect)." Grubman has also appeared on the TV shows "The View," "The <a href=# title="Janice Dickinson Net Worth">Janice Dickinson</a> Modeling Agency," "The Juice," and "The Real Housewives of New Jersey."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-204341 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Lizzie-Grubman.jpg alt="Lizzie Grubman" width=447 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-204341 class=wp-caption-text>Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Lizzie married Eric Gatoff in 1995. Gatoff was an associate at Allen's law firm, and he and Grubman divorced in 1997. Lizzie wed Chris Stern on March 17, 2006, and they have welcomed two sons together, Harrison (born December 12, 2006) and Jack (born January 22, 2009). Grubman and Stern reportedly began their relationship while Chris was married to Joyce Sevilla, one of Lizzie's employees.</p><h2 id=hamptons-crash><strong>Hamptons Crash</strong></h2><p>On July 6, 2001, Grubman found out that her mother had been diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer. According to a 2016 "New York Times" article, "In an emotional state, Ms. Grubman nevertheless went out that Friday evening to attend July 4 weekend festivities in the Hamptons. After a party at the home of Alex and Alexandra von Furstenberg, she drove the black Mercedes S.U.V. to the Conscience Point Inn, then a fashionable Southampton nightclub.</p><p>Sometime after midnight, she got into an argument with a doorman who insisted she move her car. Instead, the vehicle lurched backward into a line of waiting patrons, injuring 16 people." It was alleged that Lizzie called her victims "white trash" before striking them with her car. Grubman was charged with 26 counts, including driving while intoxicated, second-degree assault, and reckless endangerment. After reaching a plea bargain, Lizzie served 38 days in jail and was sentenced to five years' probation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvLorGzoZVitLPBwaaYp2WemsFuw86rq6Fn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flizzie-grubman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flizzie-grubman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flizzie-grubman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flizzie-grubman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flizzie-grubman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flizzie-grubman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marcus-miller-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marcus-miller-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Marcus Miller Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kiami-davael-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Kiami Davael Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kiami-davael-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
