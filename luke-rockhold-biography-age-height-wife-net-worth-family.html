Rockhold's light heavyweight debut took place against Jan Błachowicz on July 6, 2019 at UFC 239. He lost by knockout in the second round.</p><p>Rockhold was scheduled to fight on February 10, 2018, at UFC 221 against UFC Middleweight Champion <a href=#>Robert Whittaker</a>. On January 13, 2018, it was reported that Whittaker pulled out from his bout against Rockhold at UFC 221 due to a serious condition of staph infection. He was replaced by <a href=#>Yoel Romero</a> in a bout for the Interim UFC Middleweight Championship. The winner of this bout would then face Whittaker for a title unification bout. At the UFC 221 weigh-ins, Romero weighed in at 187.7 pounds, 2.7 pounds over the middleweight championship limit of 185.0 pounds. As a result, Romero was ineligible to win the championship even if he won the fight, while Rockhold would have received the Interim Championship if he had won. Romero was also fined 30% of his purse, which went to Rockhold. After a slow start, Romero knocked Rockhold out in the third round.</p><p>Rockhold was briefly linked to a light heavyweight bout with <a href=#>Alexander Gustafsson</a> on August 4, 2018 at UFC 227.

His title match against Bisping ended in the first round when Rockhold was dropped with a left hook and finished with a flurry of punches against the cage. This result was considered by many in MMA media as one of the biggest upsets in the UFC title fight history, Bisping being a huge underdog because he took the fight in only 10 days and had been submitted by Rockhold 18 months earlier.</p><p>Rockhold was expected to face <a href=#>Ronaldo Souza</a> in a rematch on November 27, 2016 at UFC Fight Night 101.
