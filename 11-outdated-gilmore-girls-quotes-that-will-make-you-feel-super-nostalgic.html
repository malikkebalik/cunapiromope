The past year has been one big revival of the early-2000s show, starting with its tremendous debut on Netflix, and culminating with the announcement that it’ll return for a four episode limited Netflix series. It’s amazing that the show has just stayed fresh this long, except wait.<i> Gilmore Girls </i>aired in the early 2000s, which means that, when you watch it now in 2015, you're quick to notice that there are a lot of <a href=# class=T3D>G<i>ilmore Girls</i> quotes that are outdated</a>, if only because we have, like, cell phones and stuff now.</p><p>Of course, there's a good chance that you might not have noticed. I mean, just like you, I myself hold the show in such high reverence that sometimes I look past all the skinny scarves and dated pop culture references. Such is life: of-the-moment jokes are the first thing to be lost to next generation <i>Gilmore Girl</i> fans. And, though I don’t mean to burst your bubble (you know, the one that views GG as a perfect show even as you slowly forget what they're referencing or talking about), it’s about time we revisit some of those lines.</p><p>There’s no doubt that the show will come back swinging strong (I’m sure Lorelai has some zingers about Kimye), ‘Till then, here are some amusingly dated lines from <i>GG</i> episodes past.</p><h3>1. "We Like Our Internet Slow, OK? We Can Turn It On, Walk Around, Do A Little Dance, Make A Sandwich. With DSL, There’s No Dancing, No Walking, And We’d Starve."</h3><p>Oh, this classic line. Of course, we can chock up Lorelai's resistance to DSL to her resistance against her mother, because even in 2000-whatever you didn't want dial-up. Like, the second you could get rid of the buffering noises that came with starting up AOL, the better.</p><h3>2. "Every Kid In That Brochure Was Awkward And Panicked. It Looked Like The Academy Award Audience During Michael Moore's Speech."</h3><p>You can definitely Google that moment of tenseness if need be, but what was probably a timely reference in 2003 doesn't age too well today.</p><h3>3. "If I Wanted To Talk To A Machine, I’d Talk To My VCR."</h3><p>And if I wanted to talk to my VCR, I'd have to find where I threw it out 16 years ago.</p><h3>4. “It’s Avril Lavigne’s World. We’re Just Living In It.”</h3><p>This is decidedly not the world we're living in now.</p><h3>5. "Guess Who’s In The Process Of Breaking Up?" "Brad And Jen?"</h3><p>Can you imagine that there were jokes made about the fragility of their relationship when it's still hard to remember a pre-Brangelina world? Jennifer and Justin Theroux for life, you guys.</p><h3>6. "Oh, Rory and Jess?" "No Ben And J. Lo. Yes Rory And Jess."</h3><p>Let's take a minute to acknowledge we have, as a nation, endured <i>two </i>Bennifer break-ups.</p><h3>7. "Maybe This Is A Cheesy Perspective To Offer You, But Gwen Stefani And Gavin Rossdale Went Through The Same Sort Of Situation. He Found Out He Had A Kid That He Didn't Know About, But They Made It Work. As Far As I Know."</h3><p>Key phrase here being "as far as I know," because Gwen Stefani is probably being cute with Blake Shelton <i>as I type this.</i></p><h3>8. "Oh, No, Not Being Attacked By A Band Of Swans. Was It An All-Boy Band? Kind Of A Scary, Feather, *NSYNC Fiasco?"</h3><p>Only '90s kids will get the reference. Or maybe not, but One Direction might be a bit more up-to-date.</p><h3>9. "Yes, I Just Want To Apologize For My Sidekick Stalking."</h3><p>Never forget that Christopher got Rory a Sidekick so he could keep tabs on her. If you totally forgot what a Sidekick was in the catalogs of cell phone history, you're not alone.</p><h3>10. "I Don't Have Any Missed Calls. Oh, Wait, There's A Little Envelope Thingy In The Bottom Corner."</h3><p>It was the innocent time for sexting.</p><h3>11. "I Can’t Believe I’m In The Blogosphere."</h3><p>Incidentally, I'm pretty sure my parents still think I work in "the blogosphere."</p><p>If you found yourself scratching your head and trying to remember what on earth your favorite Stars Hollow residents were talking about in these quotes, I don't blame you. If you weren't scratching your head, give it time. The world is changing faster that Lorelai and Rory's fast-paced pop culture references can possibly keep up with... at least until the revival.</p><p><i>Images: Wanrer Bros.
