The company has been involved in over 80 acquisitions since its founding in 1993, with some of its biggest transactions being Hostess Brands and the Pabst Brewing Company. Under Metropoulos, Pabst experienced a resurgence in popularity worldwide during the early 2010s. Dean bought Pabst in 2010 for $250 million and sold it just four years later for $750 million.

Those brands included Chef Boyardee, PAM Cooking Spray, and Bumble Bee Seafoods, most notably. He sold the company for almost $3 billion four years later.
