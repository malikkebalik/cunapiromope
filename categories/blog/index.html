Caddies generally receive 10% of the player's earnings for a victory, 7% for a top 10 finish, and 5% for everything else.</p><footer><a href=../../when-the-wealthiest-person-on-the-golf-course-is-actually-a-caddie.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../chris-adler-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Chris Adler Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
