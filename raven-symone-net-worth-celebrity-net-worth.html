Raven-Symone first became famous as a child actor on "The Cosby Show." She then launched a successful acting career as an adult. She has also earned tens of millions of dollars through a lucrative licensing empire.</p><h2 id=net-worth-misconception><strong>Net Worth Misconception</strong></h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>Raven Symone is not worth $400 million</strong>. That rumor comes from an unsubstantiated media report that estimated Raven's business empire would eventually generate $400 million in revenues for parent company Disney. That statistic is quite different from Raven Symone having a personal net worth of $400 million. Assuming that $400 million number was true, Raven would likely be entitled to only a small percentage of those profits. It would likely between 10 and 20% after taxes, management, lawyer, and operational fees. Raven's take which would be much smaller than $400 million but still quite an impressive amount. Furthermore, for anyone who still is under the impression that Raven Symone is worth $400 million personally, that would mean she has managed to earn roughly $1 billion in her lifetime to account for taxes, fees, and costs. While Raven has been very well paid in her career, this is simply not true.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Raven-Symone, also known as Raven-Symone Christina Pearman, moved to New York as a toddler and began working as a model almost immediately.

She became a household name appearing as Olivia on the show for its final two seasons. She then went on to appear in various television projects, and films, including "Queen: The Story of an American Family," in which she played the younger version of <a href=# title="Halle Berry Net Worth">Halle Berry</a>'s starring character.</p><p>Raven started a singing career at the age of seven. She was signed with MCA Records and she spent two years taking vocal lessons from Missy Elliot. Symone released her first album, "Here's to New Dreams," in 1993. Her two singles "That's What Little Girls Are Made Of" and "Raven is the Flavor" reached the lower half of the Billboard Hot 100. Due to low sales, she was dropped from the record label in 1995. Her album had sold under 100,000 copies in the United States.</p><p>Later that year, Raven landed the role of Nicole Lee on "Hangin' with Mr. Cooper."

It ran for four seasons and spawned a franchise of soundtracks, dolls, DVDs, and video games. Merchandise alone for "That's So Raven" has generated $400 million in sales worldwide to date. "That's So Raven" was nominated for two Emmys.</p><p>Symone then went on to appear in the Kim Possible series in a recurring role as Monique, the best friend of Kim Possible. That series spawned two movies, with Symone appearing in each.
