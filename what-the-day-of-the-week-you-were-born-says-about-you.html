And if you don’t already have your <a href=# class=T3D>birth chart</a> done and dusted, you’ll want to phone home and ask “what day of the week was I born?” and get other important dates handy to learn more about their significance.<strong> </strong>Your <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>life path number</a>, which can help you see what your purpose or mission is, requires you to do some math with your full birthdate, while other big numbers, like those that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>correspond to your full name</a>, for instance, or some <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>combination of your birthdate and name</a>, add to your numerology chart. All those components boil down <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>to single-digit numbers</a>, which correspond with personality traits. So what does the day you were born say about you?</p><p>First, note that there's a difference between your full birth date, and the actual day you were born. While numerology addresses the former, the latter is more of a planetary thing. Interestingly, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the days of the week are actually named after planets </a>or other stars in Hellenistic astrology: Sunday is sol, or Helios, the Sun; Monday, lunes, lunedi, or lundi in Spanish/Italian/French is luna or Selene, the Moon; Tuesday, martes, mardi or martedi in those romantic languages, is Mars; Wednesday (miercoles, mercoledi, mercredi) is named after Mercury; Thursday (jueves, giovedi, jeudi) is Jupiter; Friday (viernes, venerdi, vendredi) is Venus; and Saturday (sabado, sabato, samedi) is Saturn. The planets, in turn, are named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses, and thus they tend to have their own distinct personalities, which can correspond with days of the week, and leave their marks on those born on each day.</p><p>And, of course, if you're getting real deep, there's the popular nursery rhyme, "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Monday's Child</a>" that harkens all the way back to the 16th century:</p><p>Monday's child is fair of face</p><p>Tuesday's child is full of grace</p><p>Wednesday's child is full of woe</p><p>Thursday's child has far to go</p><p>Friday's child is loving and giving</p><p>Saturday's child works hard for a living</p><p>But the child who is born on the Sabbath day</p><p>Is bonnie and blithe and good and gay.</p><p>Numerology expert, medium, tarot card reader, and clairsentient <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Seth Vermilyea</a> tells Bustle that adding planetary influence to number theories helps to round out the characteristics of people based on the day they were born. “History will often gender and stereotype individuals,” Vermilyea says, explaining that using tarot can help to predict what people’s “attitudes and actions” will be like.</p><p>Want to decode your innate traits, or learn more about your loved ones on a mystical level? Here's a closer look at what the day you were born on says about you.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Sunday</h2></p><p>According to astrology, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>people born on Sunday</a> are lucky ducks. Their ruling star is the Sun, which typically means they'll be bright, creative, bold, and loud. Vermilyea says Sunday’s child is “often looking for their path, stands out in a crowd and looks for the spotlight.” Sundays are also the start of the week, suggesting those born on them will be natural leaders. And, of course, if you're using the nursery rhyme as your guiding light, if you’re a Sunday baby, you’re a cheery bunch, indeed.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Monday</h2></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Monday is ruled by the Moon</a>, which according to astrology, is a maternal entity rooted in dedication to kindness and family. In that vein, people born on Mondays are motherly, sensitive, adaptive, and kind. “They may take time to make decisions, reveal their (and others) truth in mysterious ways, and be naturally psychic,” Vermilyea adds. According to the nursery rhyme, Monday babies are physically attractive, too. Believe what you wish.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Tuesday</h2></p><p>In Greek and Roman mythology, Mars (or Ares) is the War God, and so <a href=# rel=noreferrer>people born on Tuesdays come with a fiery, fighting spirit</a>. These folks are brave, impatient, energetic, active, and driven to succeed, sometimes to a fault. Vermilyea tells Bustle that Tuesday’s babies have an “energy that feels like a push rather than a pull,” and that they may feel “as if they have a greater destiny to fulfill.” Or, as the nursery rhyme goes, they're "full of grace."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Wednesday</h2></p><p>Mercury is the god of <a href=#>finance, travel, and communication</a> — you may remember his Greek counterpart, Hermes, as the sneaker-and-sunglasses-wearing god from the Disney movie Hercules — and so it stands that Wednesday's children are very communicative. They're also versatile, and a bit careless, though so are the best of us. “They are also capable of many pursuits and will seek several options until they land on the one that suits them best,” Vermilyea says. “These efforts may feel like many failures rather than many experiments to a greater outcome,” he adds. According to the nursery rhyme, they're also very melancholy.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Thursday</h2></p><p>The thur in Thursday is actually derived from the Norse god Thor, who you may recall from the Marvel Avengers series. Unfortunately, people born on Thursdays do not automatically get to resemble Chris Hemsworth, but they do take on many of <a href=#>Thor’s personality trait</a>s. Thor or Jupiter, in the Roman, is optimistic, genial, and generally a fun god to be around, which means Thursday's babies get to be the life of the party. Additionally, Vermilyea says, “They may find themselves in need of controlling a situation, judging an event, or in a management or other leadership role.” Of course, the nursery rhyme claims Thursday's child has "far to go," which, can be interpreted as ambitious.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Friday</h2></p><p>Friday is ruled by <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Venus</a>, the planet of love, balance, beauty, romance, elegance, and pleasure. Lucky Friday babies are social animals, artistic, and obsessed with beauty and love, though they can also be downright narcissists. Vermilyea says that although Friday’s child is an “artisan in life” they can also be “a bit scattered,” as their creative pursuits are born from life experience.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Saturday</h2></p><p>Finally, Saturday's children come courtesy of Saturn, the god of wealth, freedom, and agriculture (gods had a lot of duties in Roman times). Tragically, this does not mean that Saturday babies will grow up to be rich, but they will be modest, studious, wise, practical, and strict — and according to the nursery rhyme, they’re hard workers. Vermilyea says those born on a Saturday can come across as “very severe and in control,” but to counter that is “their study of philosophy and refined poise and conversation.” AKA a very interesting dinner guest.</p></figure><p>Source:</p><p>Seth Vermilyea, medium, tarot card reader and clairsentient, at <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Psychics1on1</a>.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on March 8, 2018</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC4yJ%2BcaK%2BYlsFuwMeeZJ2ZqWK8p3nToZxmr5WauG7Fzq5ksJ2imnqju9GnZKyZqah6oq7OrqtmsZ%2Bq</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-the-day-of-the-week-you-were-born-says-about-you.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-the-day-of-the-week-you-were-born-says-about-you.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-the-day-of-the-week-you-were-born-says-about-you.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-the-day-of-the-week-you-were-born-says-about-you.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-the-day-of-the-week-you-were-born-says-about-you.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-the-day-of-the-week-you-were-born-says-about-you.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-gillie-de-kid-wife-regina-family-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-gillie-de-kid-wife-regina-family-and-net-worth.html>Who Is Gillie De Kid Wife Regina?
