Why? Since the beginning of her relationship with Kody Brown, she appears to have wanted something more than the polygamy she professed to need. However, during season 3, Robyn uttered nine conniving words which were an eye-opening window into the truth about her <a href=#>behavior toward</a> the <a href=#>Brown family</a> patriarch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robyn-brown-played-kody-brown-and-won>Robyn Brown played Kody Brown and won</h2><p id=par-2_37>Although Robyn Brown hailed from a polygamist family, she lived monogamy with her first husband, David Jessop. However, she maintained she wanted to live polygamy and for her children to have this shared family experience as well.</p><p id=par-3_35>There appeared to be many red flags at the beginning of <a href=#>Robyn and Kody’s relationship</a>: long weekends with Kody at her home during their courtship, lies about her wedding dress, and an extended honeymoon.</p><p id=par-4_33>In fact, early seasons of Sister Wives painted Robyn as a bit of a firecracker. She often spoke her mind, much like Christine Brown. In contrast, Meri and Janelle didn’t ruffle family feathers.</p><p id=par-5_35>During a season 3 moment, Kody left Robyn’s <a href=#>Las Vegas home</a> to pick up a pair of sweats at Christine’s house. Robyn deviously giggled and said, “I usually don’t let him out of my sight.”</p><p id=par-6_42>Kody adored being put on a pedestal and lapped up Robyn’s affection. Compared to Meri, Janelle, and Christine, whom he had already been married to for many years, Robyn validated Kody in her life in a way the other women did not.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robyn-brown-monopolized-kody-brown-s-time-from-the-beginning-of-their-relationship>Robyn Brown monopolized Kody Brown’s time from the beginning of their relationship</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_44>From the beginning of season 1, Robyn Brown made it clear her time with Kody Brown was just as important as his with Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown. She even stood up to the women to explain why hers was as valuable as theirs.</p><p id=par-8_69>Christine and Meri argued Robyn’s position as then-fiancé did not merit the same amount of time with Kody as a wife. She’d only become an equal partner once they were officially wed. From her perspective, Robyn believed it was necessary to have the time to foster her relationship with Kody and for him to get to really know her three children from a prior marriage: Dayton, Aurora, and Breanna.</p><p id=par-9_22>“Well, my kids moved,” Robyn said in a confessional. Meri added, “Everyone’s lives are going through big changes, not just your kids.”</p><p id=par-10_35>Therefore, Kody gave Robyn preferential treatment even before their marriage. This continued after they married. As the seasons progressed and Kody gravitated more to Robyn’s home, his relationships with his other wives became more strained.</p><p id=par-11_37>It appeared Robyn kept her family separate from the supersized Brown family for a reason. Outside of the bubble of his other relationships, Robyn allowed Kody the freedom to forget the problems of leading a polygamist family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robyn-brown-claims-to-understand-kody-best>Robyn Brown claims to understand Kody best</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_41>Robyn Brown’s biggest ace in the hole was keeping the honeymoon phase of her marriage going while the other wives did not. By the time she entered the family, Kody, Meri, Janelle, and Christine had been a unit for 16 years.</p><p id=par-13_29>When Robyn entered the picture, things in the Brown family were upended. Simultaneously, TLC hired the family for Sister Wives, so significant changes shifted the balance of the clan.</p><p id=par-14_41>However, while the other wives struggled with making ends meet, Robyn’s job appeared to be to give Kody attention. She catered to him, something that his other three wives, working and mothers of a combined 13 children, could no longer do.</p><p id=par-15_48>Strangely, Meri, Janelle, and Christine held different jobs within the family, but Robyn didn’t have to work. She left herself available to Kody at all times, and he relied on the other women to take on childcare, jobs, events, and the day-to-day tasks involved with running multiple households.</p><p id=par-16_44>As Robyn’s power within the family increased and she became Kody’s legal wife, she claimed she didn’t involve herself in her sister wives’ marriages. In response, Christine and Janelle called Robyn out for trying to “mediate” their unions during a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sister Wives One-on-One special</a>.</p><p id=par-17_44>Christine said, ” I have known Kody for a long time. I met him when I was 18. What, 32 years ago? I’ve known Kody for a long time, and I can actually read Kody pretty well. And I can speak Kody well, too.”</p><p id=par-18_33>Janelle added, ” I don’t know if I really need someone to translate for me. We’ve been married a long time. We did OK without you,'” she says. “I think I speak Kody.”</p><p id=par-19_11>Sister Wives is currently on hiatus. The series airs on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqr%2FTnqlmr5mrsrR5wqilp6GmnruoecyopJ6mpGK%2FsK7Yp2Sbqp%2Bsu268y5qwnpxdoLylxYybqaivnmLEsLqNoaumpF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-conniving-moment-robyn-brown-played-kody-brown-and-won.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-conniving-moment-robyn-brown-played-kody-brown-and-won.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-conniving-moment-robyn-brown-played-kody-brown-and-won.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-conniving-moment-robyn-brown-played-kody-brown-and-won.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-conniving-moment-robyn-brown-played-kody-brown-and-won.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-conniving-moment-robyn-brown-played-kody-brown-and-won.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chris-pratt-and-charlie-day-horrified-by-unsettling-mario-mushroom-theory.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chris-pratt-and-charlie-day-horrified-by-unsettling-mario-mushroom-theory.html>Chris Pratt and Charlie Day horrified by unsettling Mario mushroom theory</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kat-von-d-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Kat Von D Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kat-von-d-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
