Macron subsequently earned a master's degree in public affairs from Sciences Po.

After earning the most votes in the first round of the election in 2017, handily defeating François Fillon, he moved on to the second round to face National Front candidate <a href=# title="Marine Le Pen Net Worth">Marine Le Pen</a>. Macron ended up being victorious, winning with 66.1% of the vote. As a result, he became the youngest French president ever, at the age of 39. Macron went on to secure a majority in the National Assembly, and to appoint Édouard Philippe as prime minister. He subsequently appointed <a href=# title="Jacques Chirac Net Worth">Jacques Chirac</a> after Philippe resigned in 2020. Macron was elected to a second presidential term in 2022, once again beating Le Pen. However, his political coalition lost its absolute majority in the legislative election.</p><p>During his presidency, Macron has overseen a number of reforms in the areas of taxation, pensions, and labor laws. Many of these reforms angered rightwing people, leading to the chaotic Yellow Vest Protests and pension reform strike in 2018 and 2019. Starting in early 2020, Macron led France's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, earning praise for his handling of the vaccination rollout. Meanwhile, in terms of foreign policy, he has pushed for reforms to the European Union and signed bilateral treaties with Germany and Italy. Among his other notable actions, Macron continued Opération Chammal to curb the threat of Islamist terrorism; coordinated massive trade agreements with China during the China-United States trade war; and joined other countries in the global denunciation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><h2 id=political-leanings><strong>Political Leanings</strong></h2><p>Widely considered a centrist and economic neoliberal, Macron favors the free market and&nbsp; reducing the public-finances deficit.

In terms of the environment, Macron has supported the transition to renewable energy.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2007, Macron married his former high school teacher Brigitte Trogneux. Although they first met when he was 15 and she was 39, they only began dating when Macron turned 18, much to his parents' chagrin. Trogneux has three children from a prior marriage.</p><p>Macron is an avid piano player, having studied the instrument for ten years during his youth. He also enjoys skiing, boxing, and playing tennis. As a sports fan, Macron supports the French football club Olympique de Marseille. He also attended the finals of the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups, cheering on as France won the former and narrowly lost the latter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6sbvLoquim5mWu7R7z6ucrKGUmru1v46epKaZnqqyrXnMmpqrp55iu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2femmanuel-macron-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2femmanuel-macron-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2femmanuel-macron-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2femmanuel-macron-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2femmanuel-macron-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2femmanuel-macron-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./felix-lee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./felix-lee.html>Felix Lee</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./all-boruto-arcs-in-order.html>All Boruto arcs in order</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./all-boruto-arcs-in-order.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
