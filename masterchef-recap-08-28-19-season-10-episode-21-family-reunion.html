Sarah’s husband Michael is brought out. Noah’s mom, Nick’s Dad..Cherry’s husband. Subha’s wife. Dorian’s husband… Sherrie’s husband.</p><p>Unfortunately, Micah’s family did not show up tonight due to them not supporting his dream in becoming a chef… tonight’s challenge is to make the judges a dish of a favorite family dish with three chefs receiving immunity tonight. Even though Micah mother wasn’t there to show support Gordon gives him some inspirational words as his dish was inspired by his mom.</p><p>Others prepare passed down generational family dishes. The chefs’ race to prepare the dishes with confidence as this seems to be dishes they have prepared many times before and are comfortable with the presentation in hopes of impressing the judges.</p><p>Nick prepares a poached lobster dish that doesn’t do to well for the judges, Noah prepares a seabass that also falls flat, Sarah cooks salmon that finally does well with judges, Subha cooks Morrocan chicken that does ok, Sarah does a bass that’s a hit, Dorian cooks a pork chop meal that the judges are split between good and her taking a step back in her progression.</p><p>Micah cooks a lamb chop that is not cooked and judges feel undercooked…the three that gets immunity are Sheri, Dorian and Sarah’ leaving Noah, Nick, Micah and Subha in the bottom 4.</p><p>With the bottom four men fighting to stay in the competition they each must prepare dishes recreated from chef Gordon potato crusted sea bass and clam..they will so be cooking alongside Gordon and at his place, as he is their clock. Gordon is very fast-paced and the chefs attempt to keep up one slip up and the chefs are doomed..for the most part they seem to be&nbsp;doing well with the timing until Micah cuts himself ..while the others chefs continue on to the difficult part of the dish which is the seating of the fish and the technique used to cook it.subha and Micah fish don’t too well but must continue on nick and Noah take the lead.</p><p>Now comes the plating of the food as they have 60 seconds and rush to copy exactly how Gordon Ramsey plated his dish. the judges now move on to taste testing, up first is Nick which earns good reviews for taste and presentation…next up is Noah which gets praise from Gordon and does ok..Subha is next, visually his dish doesn’t do good with the chefs and is a disaster and disappointment..taste wise he falls flat as well and they give him harsh criticism.</p><p>Lastly, Micah is up for review as his fish is undercooked the surrounding food like the minestrone and vegetables on the dish redeems him. Noah and Nick are safe as the two worst chefs dishes Subha and Micah land in the bottom two.. ultimately Micah is sent home as it seems not having his family’s support tonight took a toll on him and has gotten him eliminated</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaHJnnZbAtbHRnJ%2Benl2nsqStz2ZncWVibXpyhYysnJqrn6N6cnyMnqeiq5%2BZsm5%2BkGadmqWZocZuvsSupaKnnmQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmasterchef-recap-08-28-19-season-10-episode-21-family-reunion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmasterchef-recap-08-28-19-season-10-episode-21-family-reunion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmasterchef-recap-08-28-19-season-10-episode-21-family-reunion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmasterchef-recap-08-28-19-season-10-episode-21-family-reunion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmasterchef-recap-08-28-19-season-10-episode-21-family-reunion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmasterchef-recap-08-28-19-season-10-episode-21-family-reunion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-elinor-donahue-make-latest-income-salary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-elinor-donahue-make-latest-income-salary.html>How Much Money Does Elinor Donahue Make?
