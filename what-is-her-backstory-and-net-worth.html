Here’s a look at the <a href=#>actress’s background</a>, family life, and net worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/hunter-tylo.png><h2>What was Tylo’s first main gig?</h2><p id=par-5_39>It may feel like Tylo has been Taylor forever, but The Bold and the Beautiful is not where she started. Tylo, a Texas native born Deborah Jo Hunter, dipped her toes into acting waters with theatrical productions before venturing into television.</p><p id=par-6_43>Prior to that, she earned a pre-med degree at Fordham University and worked as model, per <a href=#>IMDb</a>. Her first film was The Initiation 1984, and Tylo also did stints on All My Children and Days of Our Lives between 1985 and 1990.</p><p id=par-7_22>In 1990, she was cast as the psychiatrist Taylor Hayes in B&B and has played the character for more than two decades.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Tylo had her first child young, married twice</h2><p id=par-8_48>As a high school senior, Tylo wound up pregnant with her first child, Christopher. She was briefly married to her son’s father but after divorcing, made ends meet by working three jobs. She was discovered by a casting director for All My Children while working at her dinner theater job.</p><p id=par-9_31>After moving to New York, she met Michael Tylo on the set of AMC. According to an old interview with <a href=#>Soap Opera Digest</a>, it caused problems at work with one of the producers:</p><p>“We had a falling-out with him because he didn’t want us dating or getting married. Another actor who’d dated a co-star on the show experienced a similar problem and he warned us about it, but we thought our situation was different.</p><p>We dated secretly for about six months, then told the producer we were getting married, and it caused a little explosion. I don’t understand it myself. It was very strange. I think they’d planned to put us in a love triangle and were afraid that the fact that we were married might make it biased. But I simply don’t know.”</p><p id=par-10_52>She left the show shortly after and the pair married in 1987, and Tylo had three more children before the couple divorced in 2005. One of her sons, Michael Tylo, Jr. tragically passed away in a drowning incident, and daughter Katya lost an eye to a rare form of retinal cancer. Tylo has since remarried.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Tylo’s career has helped her grow her wealth</h2><p id=par-11_52>In an unfortunate turn of events, Tylo was fired from a 1996 gig on Melrose Place, a job that led to her taking a hiatus from B&B. She was let go after they learned she was pregnant, causing Tylo to file a discrimination lawsuit against Aaron Spelling and his production company.</p><p id=par-12_42>She won $5 million in litigation and went back to work on The Bold and the Beautiful. Tylo supports charitable causes such as those focused on cancer, adoption awareness, and epilepsy. Her fortune, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, is estimated to be $13 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMm6alnF2Wu6V506GcZpqVlsK1tcWuo2aZk6m%2Fpr%2FSZp%2BupqSav27A2KWmZq%2BYlsFutdJmn56qXZeupLfSraarsV2Wu6V5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpesetpKVn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-her-backstory-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-her-backstory-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-her-backstory-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-her-backstory-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-her-backstory-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-her-backstory-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./did-mary-j-blige-and-jodeci-s-k-ci-ever-get-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./did-mary-j-blige-and-jodeci-s-k-ci-ever-get-married.html>Did Mary J.
