Considered a throw-in in the trade, Carter forever cemented his place in Knicks lore when he nearly singlehandedly rallied New York to a playoff victory in an elimination game against the Boston Celtics on April 24, 2011. Carter substituted into the game with the Knicks trailing by 23 and brought life back to the Garden by suffocating <a href=#>Rajon Rondo</a> on defense, scoring 11 points, and dishing four dimes. However, the Knicks' comeback bid ultimately fell short.</p><p>On December 12, 2011, Carter signed with the Toronto Raptors. He was waived by the Raptors on March 15, 2012. In October 2012, he re-joined the Nuggets for their training camp, but did not make the team's final roster.</p><p>On July 14, 2010, he re-signed with the Nuggets to a one-year contract worth $1.3 million.</p><p>On August 14, 2009, the Nuggets again re-signed Carter to a one-year contract for $1.3 million.</p><p>On July 1, 2008, Carter became a free agent, but re-signed with Denver in October.</p><p>After two relatively uneventful seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves (2004–06), on April 12, 2007, the Denver Nuggets signed Carter for the remainder of the season, after he started the year with Italy's Scafati Basket. He was waived by the team on August 29, and re-signed two days later.</p><p>On December 20, 2007, Carter hit a runner in the lane with 0.8 seconds left in double overtime against the Houston Rockets, which gave the Nuggets a 112–111 win. In that season, he recorded individual records in most statistical categories, averaging a career-high 8&nbsp;ppg, while starting all but three of the games he appeared in.</p><p>In 2003, Carter's agent failed to notify the&nbsp;Heat&nbsp;that Carter wished to exercise a $4.1 million player option on his contract by the June 30 deadline. The failure allowed the team to renounce their rights to Carter, opening up cap space that was later used to sign&nbsp;Lamar Odom.</p><p>Carter later signed with the San Antonio Spurs. However, after only five games, the Spurs waived him due to injury, and he remained inactive throughout 2003–04.</p><p>While Carter was in fifth grade at Atlanta's Fred A. Toomer Elementary School, his class was adopted by the "I Have a Dream" foundation. In 2003, he was appointed as the first-ever spokesperson for the foundation.</p><p>After going undrafted in the 1998 NBA draft, he began his NBA career with the Miami Heat, after having spent one season with CBA's Yakima Sun Kings.</p><p>Carter played collegiately at Saddleback Community College in Mission Viejo, California (1994–96), then went on to play at the University of Hawaii. At UH, Carter became the Rainbows' career leader in assist average and one of only 10 players to reach 1,000 points.</p><p>Anthony Bernard Carter (born June 16, 1975) is an American basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Miami Heat. He played college basketball for Saddleback College and Hawaii.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVflru1tM6nsGabkafBpr4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanthony-carter-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanthony-carter-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanthony-carter-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanthony-carter-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanthony-carter-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanthony-carter-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bill-anderson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bill-anderson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Bill Anderson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./noreen-greenley-missing-update-2023-is-she-found-yet.html>Noreen Greenley Missing Update 2023: Is She Found Yet?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./noreen-greenley-missing-update-2023-is-she-found-yet.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
